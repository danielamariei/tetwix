### Nostalgia & Bonding
Puzzle games are one of the most fun and competitive out on the market. But most of us have one retro love of this type: **Tetris**  
**TeTwix** promises to bring back to you the thrill of achieving a new hi-score, of clearing a line in the last moment, of scoring a combo, of challenging your friends. If you love Tetris you have to try TeTwix.
### Name
We started out to create a collaborative Tetris game and we where inspired by the famous chocolate double-bar, Twix.
### Innovation
Unlike the old Tetris where you had you have the actual device and controlled one falling piece at a time, with TeTwix you can play right on your laptop or PC and you have a challenge of controlling two pieces.  
You can choose to play the traditional way by using the keyboard and mouse or a game controller, or you can play it using a LEAP Motion Controller which takes advantage of hand gestures. Spoiler alert: it's crazy fun!
### Business
While playing the game you will notice some levels sponsored by our partners. When you complete such a level you will receive a special achievement trophy on behalf of our sponsors.  
These levels are easily recognizable, the sponsor logo will be placed on the game board background.
