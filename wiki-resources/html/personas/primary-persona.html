                    <p>Being a competitive person in nature, he uses games as a
                        mean to engage in fun competitions with his friends,
                        using social networks to brag about his
                        achievements.</p>

                    <p>Since he is far away from home and his parents, Michel

                        with them.

                <h5>Detailed Description</h5>

                <p>Michel is a ten-year-old boy from Lyon, France. After
                    observing his extraordinary intellectual capabilities, his
                    parents decided to send him to The International School of
                    Paris (ISP), a private school based in Paris, France. In
                    this stimulating environment, Michel began to cultivate his
                    mind and became one of the best students.</p>

                <p>Attending computer technology courses -- since the school is
                    equipped with a computer technology lab -- Michel developed
                    a specific interest towards <b>computer technology</b>. After
                    talking with his parents about his interests, they decided
                    to buy him a laptop which he can use both to study for
                    school and also <b>experience new technologies</b> and have
                    fun.</p>

                <p>Thus, he always wants to find out more about how computers
                    work; likewise he is always in seek for <>new and interesting
                    games, which he can use to <b>have fun</b> in his spare time.</p>

                <p>Being a <b>competitive person</b> in nature, one of the methods he
                    uses to exteriorise itself is is to <b>challenge his colleagues</b>
                    to play games against him. This enables him to evidentiate
                    as a dominant person, by winning the games against his
                    colleagues.</p>

                <p>Michel also has an appeal to <b>new technologies</b>. He is
                    fascinated by the new technologies that enable him <b>new means
                    of interaction with the computer</b>. He also uses social
                    networks to keep in touch with his friends and sometimes
                    also uses them to <b>brag about his achievements</b> or similar
                    things.</p>

                <p>Since he is far away from home and his parents, Michel tries
                    to find new and fun methods to spend with them when at home.
                    Most of the time he wants to just stay in the <b>comfort of his
                    home, playing collaborative games with them</b>.</p>
