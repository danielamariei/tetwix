                at a private school in Paris, France, far away from his
                home-town Lyon.</p>

            <p>Over the time Michel has developed an affinity towards
                computer technology, with a particular interest in
                games.</p>

            <p>Being a competitive person in nature, he uses games as a
                mean to engage in fun competitions with his friends,
                using social networks to brag about his
                achievements.</p>

            <p>Since he is far away from home and his parents, Michel
                tries to find new and fun methods to spend with them
                when at home. This includes playing collaborative games
                with them.

                   <p>Michel is a ten-year-old boy from Lyon, France. After
                    observing his extraordinary intellectual capabilities, his
                    parents decided to send him to The International School of
                    Paris (ISP), a private school based in Paris, France. In
                    this stimulating environment, Michel began to cultivate his
                    mind and became one of the best students.</p>

                <p>Attending computer technology courses -- since the school is
                    equipped with a computer technology lab -- Michel developed
                    a specific interest towards <b>computer technology</b>. After
                    talking with his parents about his interests, they decided
                    to buy him a laptop which he can use both to study for
                    school and also <b>experience new technologies</b> and have
                    fun.</p>

                <p>Thus, he always wants to find out more about how computers
                    work; likewise he is always in seek for <>new and interesting
                    games, which he can use to <b>have fun</b> in his spare time.</p>

                <p>Being a <b>competitive person</b> in nature, one of the methods he
                    uses to exteriorise itself is is to <b>challenge his colleagues</b>
                    to play games against him. This enables him to evidentiate
                    as a dominant person, by winning the games against his
                    colleagues.</p>

                <p>Michel also has an appeal to <b>new technologies</b>. He is
                    fascinated by the new technologies that enable him <b>new means
                    of interaction with the computer</b>. He also uses social
                    networks to keep in touch with his friends and sometimes
                    also uses them to <b>brag about his achievements</b> or similar
                    things.</p>

                <p>Since he is far away from home and his parents, Michel tries
                    to find new and fun methods to spend with them when at home.
                    Most of the time he wants to just stay in the <b>comfort of his
                    home, playing collaborative games with them</b>.</p>

    <b>Michel plays a game with his father for the first time</b>
    <ol>

        <li><p>Michel goes to the web page and opens the game on his
            laptop;</p>
        <li><p>The application detects and displays all the input
            devices that are
            connected, and from which it can receive input;</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Michel selects the option to start a new game;</p></li>
        <li><p>A splash screen appears informing Michel that he and his
            father can watch a demo regarding how to play the game;</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Michel approves and he watches the demo with his
            father;</p></li>
        <li><p>After they learn how to play the game, they proceed and
            start controlling tetris pieces.</p></li>

    </ol>
    <b>Modifying the speed of the game</b>
    <ol>

        <li><p>Michel selects the <i>game settings</i> button from the
            main
            menu;</p>
        <li><p>After the button is selected a menu with several options
            appears;</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Next, Michel select the <i>modify game speed</i> option
            from the
            menu;</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>This choice leads the boy to a new menu, where he can
            select
            the desired speed using a range input;</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>While adjusting the range input, Michel can see in
            another
            frame a tetris piece moving at the currently selected speed;
            the piece adapts dynamically its speed according to the
            selection in the range input.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <b>Sharing a high-score using a social network</b>
    <ol>

        <li><p>Michel ends playing a game, making a new high-score;</p>
        <li><p>After finishing the game, a modal interface appears to
            him presenting his achievement and different social networks
            on which he can share his high-score;</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>He selects a social network, after which the application
            shares his high-score, informing Michel with a
            corresponding dialog.</p>
        </li>
