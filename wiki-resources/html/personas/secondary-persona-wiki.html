She tries to spend as much time as possible with them, inspiring them to develop their creativity and enhance their learning process. Since she has studies in applied psychology, she knows that in order for her children to obtain good academic results they must follow the rules of a balanced life. This includes doing recreational activities.</p>

        <p>One of the ways in which Kareen likes most to use her spare time with her children is to play games together. Thus, she is always in seek of new games that she can play with them. Moreover, she tries to make them feel comfortable in this era of advanced technology through the use of non-conventional interface in the games they play (i.e. gestural, locomotion, etc.).</p>
